# StatisticalInference_Project
This is a repository for putting the course project in Statistical Inference, so that I can easily edit somewhere else.

This is the project for the statistical inference class. In it, you will use simulation to explore inference and do some simple inferential data analysis. The project consists of two parts:

1. A simulation exercise.
2. Basic inferential data analysis.
